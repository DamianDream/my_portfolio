### About
 - Welcome to my portfolio website! - 
I'm a front-end developer with a passion for coding.
With expertise in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, and Git.

## NOTE: 
This website was created as simply as possible, with HTML, CSS, and a micro-sample of JavaScript. Hope you find it nice !)
